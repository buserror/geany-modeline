I like to write different languages with different tab width settings.
Modelines are incredibly handy for accomplishing this, as well as
accomplishing other formatting tasks.  Currently, I have only implemented
support for the following, also found in VIM:

  expandtab (et) - Makes tab produce spaces
  noexpandtab    - Tab produces \t
  tabstop (ts)   - Basically the tab size
  wrap           - Wrap lines
  nowrap         - Don't wrap lines
